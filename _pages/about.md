## About me
I am a researcher at Zhongguancun Academy. Prior to this, I served as a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, where I worked for seven years. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2013 and 2018, respectively, under the supervision of [Dr. Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.bjzgca.edu.cn/PicDetail.aspx?ID=285) and [Prof. Nenghai Yu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ynh/).

## I will add more information when I am free.
